The website I used to create this code is https://www.howtogeek.com/build-a-simple-to-do-list-app-with-python/
- I chose this because I feel like out of all the coding languages I have the hardest time with python, and the fact that it is the most important, I need to improve my basic skills and always be working on bettering my knowledge of the language. Also, I did this because it is fun and interactive instead of just data based.
