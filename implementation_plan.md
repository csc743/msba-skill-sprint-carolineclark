This repository contains a simple Python to-do list make for me that I can use to view, add, complete and delete tasks. With this program, an everyday task can be made virtual using programming. To use this for a real company, many things would need to change as this is just a super simple to do list made for me. In a company, tasks would need to be stored somewhere, and a it would need to be web based so that many employees could use it to manage tasks. Also, more features would need to be added such as deadlines, urgency, and a dashboard to track progress.
